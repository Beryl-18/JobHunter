# Job Hunter 

This is my first React-Native Appliaction! This is a Job portal application that pulls listings from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Ziprecruiter and more using an api from RapidAPI. 

<!-- 
Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router
```
